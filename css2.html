  <p class="sad"><em>I've been smoking</em> <br><em>on the peace pipe</em></p>
  <p class="potato">I've been wondering just what would peace be like<br>
  I've been staring into headlights<br>
  Swallow me whole, finding my peace of mind<br>
  I'm just trying to seize the moment<br>
  Trying to love the little things, even if they're hard to love<br>
  A monument to love unspoken<br>
  Carved into stone, unwilling to come undone<br>

  It feels good to be running from the devil<br>
  Another breath and I'm up another level<br>
  It feels good to be up above the clouds<br>
  It feels good for the first time in a long time now<br>

  I remember back in Oakland<br>
  I was lying there in rapture on the bathroom floor<br>
  Moving hotel to hotel<br>
  Out on the road, no idea really what's in store<br>
  Light it up just like a flashlight<br>
  Let it shine, let it rise just like a foreign sun<br>
  Turn it over and it's capsized<br>
  It's finally done, the battle's lost yet I feel I've won</p><br>

  It feels good to be running from the devil<br>
  Another breath and I'm up another level<br>
  It feels good to be up above the clouds<br>
  It feels good for the first time in a long time now<br>

  It feels good for the first time in a long time now<br>
  It feels good to be me<br>

  I'm high, staring at the ceiling<br>
  Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling<br>
  What comes next, I see a light<br>
  I'm along for the ride as I'm taking flight<br>

  I'm high, staring at the ceiling<br>
  Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling<br>
  What comes next, I see a light<br>
  I'm along for the ride as I'm taking flight<br>

  It feels good to be running from the devil<br>
  Another breath and I'm up another level<br>
  It feels good to be up above the clouds<br>
  It feels good for the first time in a long time now<br>

  It feels good for the first time in a long time to be me<br>
  It feels good for the first time in a while I'm free<br>

  I'm high, staring at the ceiling<br>
  Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling<br>
  What comes next, I see a light<br>
  I'm along for the ride as I'm taking flight<br>
